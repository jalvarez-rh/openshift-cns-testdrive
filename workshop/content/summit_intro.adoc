= Welcome to the Hands on with OCP Plus Workshop for Summit 2023

=== Introduction

In this workshop, we aim to cover the fundamental aspects of Openshift Ops and delve into the operations side of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes. Participants can expect to gain a comprehensive understanding of the basics of Openshift Ops, such as Environment Overview, Installation and Verification, and LDAP - Configuring External Authentication Providers. Furthermore, we will explore the operational capabilities of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes and Red Hat Advanced Cluster Security for Kubernetes, providing attendees with a well-rounded understanding of how to optimize and secure their Kubernetes environments. Overall, this workshop promises to be a valuable learning experience for anyone looking to expand their knowledge of OCP Plus.

=== Admin Ops Modules

The Admin Ops section of the workshop is divided into two modules: the first module focuses on Openshift, a container application platform that uses Kubernetes for managing and automating the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications. The second module provides an introduction to OpenShift Ops, covering the basics of the OpenShift 4 cluster installation and utilizing a Kubernetes feature called ServiceAccounts to interact with the OpenShift API.

=== Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes

The Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM) module is designed to provide a hands-on learning experience for IT professionals looking to deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters at scale. The workshop will walk through the deployment and management of Kubernetes clusters using RHACM. Participants will learn how to manage Open shift clusters in various stages, from Hosted Control Plane OpenShift Clusters to Single Nodes and more. We will also automate application deployment and gain visibility into their infrastructure using advanced features such as policy-based governance.
